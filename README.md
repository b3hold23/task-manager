## Description
This README is more for practice on how to make read me files for projects. With that being said let me tell you about this project. This is a Task Manager project, When you want to add a task you can add it into the input and either press the enter key or press the add button. If you need to make it urgent You can click the urgent button on the side of the task and it will change the color of the task to red. Once the task is completed you can click on it and it will change the color of the task to green. You can double click the task to delete the specific task.  

## Features
* Add Tasks: Users can add task using the input field and the "Add Task" button.

* Mark Tasks as Urgent: Each task has an "Urgent" button that changes the task's color to indicate the urgency (changes the color to red).

* Mark Tasks as complete: Clicking a task marks it as completed by changing its color to green.

* Remove Task: Double- clicking on a task will delete it from the list and delete it from local storage.

* Clear All Button: By clicking the "Clear All" Button it will remove all of the tasks from the list and will delete them from the local storage.

* Persistent storage: The task that you create get saved to the Local storage and are retrieved when the page is reloaded.  

## Installation

## Usage
Ok, his part will have information on the code that I used to make this project work. With that being said let us begin. This project mainly uses JavaScript to create Elements that will contain the task text. This project is used for a place to store your task and let you mark some of the task from urgent and completed tasks as well. I am using the createElement() method to create the list of tasks and their urgent buttons. I use addEventListener() method to be able to add functionality to the site when you click on the tasks, add or delete the tasks. Tasks are saved using localStorage.setItem() and retrieved with localStorage.getItem() to ensure persistence across page reloads.
